# Directions
Press the spacebar to move the puck from the middle; it will go either up or down at a random angle.
One player controls the top paddle by clicking the left and right arrow keys (the left arrow key moves it to the left, and the right arrow key moves it to the right).
Another play controls the bottom paddle by clicking the 'a' and 'd' keys (the 'a' key moves it to the left, and the 'd' key moves it to the right).
Once the puck hits the paddles or the wall, it bounces off of it at an angle of 180 degrees minus the initial angle.
If the puck passes a paddle, the other player gets a point.
